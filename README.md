# SpringEventDrivenMicroservices
Udmey : Event-Driven Microservices: Spring Boot, Kafka and Elastic 

#Main Objectives & Benefits

Microservices: Independent development, independent deployment and scalable services
Spring boot and Spring cloud stack
Microservices patterns:
       - Externalized configuration -> spring cloud config
       - Api versioning 
       - Service discovery -> eureka
       - Api gateway -> spring cloud gateway
       - Circuit breaker -> spring cloud gateway  & resilience4j
       - Rate limiting -> spring cloud gateway  & redis
       - Event sourcing -> kafka
       - CQRS -> kafka & postgresql & elasticsearch
       - Authentication / Authorization with oauth 2 and open id connect -> Keycloak authz server
       - Monitoring -> Prometheus & Grafana
       - Distributed tracing, log aggregation and visualization -> Logstash & Kibana
Kafka -> Brokers, topics, partitions, producer, consumer, spring kafka
Elasticsearch -> Index api, query api, spring elastic data
Containerization with docker -> Perfect match for microservices & Ready to ship application any cloud solution
Reactive development
